# My Nvim Configuration

My personal Neovim configuration using Lua and Kickstart.nvim as the starting point.

## Extra Stuff

For now, I've decided to take a break from intensive Neovim configuration. I definitely learned a lot – that's for sure! – but I feel like I'm not quite ready yet. I still haven't fully figured out my exact needs when it comes to editors. I think I need to learn a lot more about other things and get better at various aspects before diving back into this. So, for the moment, I'll keep learning, but one step at a time.
