# My Nvim Configuration

My personal Neovim configuration using Lua and Kickstart.nvim as the starting point.

## Finally, everything works as expected

After wrestling with my Neovim setup for a while, everything is finally working the way I wanted. The root of the problem? I was stubbornly sticking to Nvim v0.10.4, never even questioning if a newer version might solve anything.

It wasnâ€™t until I hit a persistent error with `mason-lspconfig` directly tied to my outdated Nvim version, that I decided (more out of despair than strategy) to upgrade to v0.11.1.

And just like that, everything clicked into place.

Now Neovim runs smoothly, my config behaves, and most importantly, I can finally say with satisfaction:
"I use Neovim, btw."
